=====================

A simple CFML application for managing a list of available speakers (e.g. for user groups, conferences, etc.)

*NOTE*: This is alpha development code and still a work in progress. Posted so others in Team CF Advance and thee broader CFML community can also work on it.

*TO USE* you must create three encrpytion keys and assign them in the Application.cfc along with the datasource.
